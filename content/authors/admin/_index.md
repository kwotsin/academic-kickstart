I'm a final year computer science student who enjoys working on the intersection of computer vision, self-supervised learning and information theory. My current research focuses on using information theoretic ideas to improve the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Interaction often spurs new ideas - feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss about related ideas!
